# my_recipe_app

This application is a simple bootstrap demo app that takes selection
criteria, reads a public api source with those keys, presents json data
from the api in an index view, and provides links to external recipe
uri locations to further explore recipe details.

Use the browser back button to return to the index view.
Click on the application name to reinitialize the selection values.

This api source returns a max of 10 records per page, and an unknown
number of pages per set of selection values. You can tell it what 
page you want to see, and it may or may not exist. Just change your
selection values if you hit an empty set.

* Ruby version - 2.3.1
